Hi if you want to create a game using AS3IsoLib engine you can use this one becauase i wrapped them so that it will be easy to use and you don't have to study As3isolib 
right now this isoLibWrapper is still on progress so use it at your own risk or you can continue it if you want i'll be glad if that's happened. 

for questions or comments just email me @ swifer05@gmail.com or swifer_07@yahoo.com 

have fun , happy coding! ^^)
